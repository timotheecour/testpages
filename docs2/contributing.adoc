= Contributing

Contributing happens via "Pull requests" (PR) on github. Every PR needs to be
reviewed before it can be merged and the Continuous Integration should be green.

The PR has to be approved (and is often merged too) by one "code owner", either
by the code owner who is responsible for the subsystem the PR belongs to or by
two core developers or by Araq.

See link:codeowners.html[codeowners] for more details.

= Writing tests

There are 3 types of tests:

1.  `runnableExamples` documentation comment tests, ran by `nim doc mymod.nim`
These end up in documentation and ensure documentation stays in sync with code.
2.  tests in `when isMainModule:` block, ran by `nim c mymod.nim` `nimble test`
also typially runs these in external nimble packages.
3.  testament tests, eg: tests/stdlib/tospaths.nim (only used for Nim repo).

Not all the tests follow the convention here, feel free to change the ones that
don't. Always leave the code cleaner than you found it.

== Stdlib

If you change the stdlib (anything under `lib/`, eg `lib/pure/ospaths.nim`), put
a test in the file you changed. Add the tests under a `when isMainModule:`
condition so they only get executed when the tester is building the file. Each
test should be in a separate `block:` statement, such that each has its own
scope. Use boolean conditions and `doAssert` for the testing by itself, don't
rely on echo statements or similar.

Sample test:

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
when isMainModule:
  block: # newSeqWith tests
    var seq2D = newSeqWith(4, newSeq[bool](2))
    seq2D[0][0] = true
    seq2D[1][0] = true
    seq2D[0][1] = true
    doAssert seq2D == @[@[true, true], @[true, false],
                        @[false, false], @[false, false]]
    # doAssert with `not` can be done as follows:
    doAssert: not 1 == 2
----

Newer tests tend to be run via `testament` rather than via `when isMainModule:`,
eg `tests/stdlib/tospaths.nim`; this allows additional features such as custom
compiler flags; for more details see below.

== Compiler

The tests for the compiler use a testing tool called `testament`. They are all
located in `tests/` (eg: `tests/destructor/tdestructor3.nim`). Each test has its
own file. All test files are prefixed with `t`. If you want to create a file for
import into another test only, use the prefix `m`.

At the beginning of every test is the expected behavior of the test. Possible
keys are:

* output: The expected output, most likely via `echo`
* exitcode: Exit code of the test (via `exit(number)`)
* errormsg: The expected error message
* file: The file the errormsg was produced at
* line: The line the errormsg was produced at

For a full spec, see here: `testament/specs.nim`

An example for a test:

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
discard """
  errormsg: "type mismatch: got (PTest)"
"""

type
  PTest = ref object

proc test(x: PTest, y: int) = nil

var buf: PTest
buf.test()
----

= Running tests

You can run the tests with

....
./koch tests
....

which will run a good subset of tests. Some tests may fail. If you only want to
see the output of failing tests, go for

....
./koch tests --failing all
....

You can also run only a single category of tests. A category is a subdirectory
in the `tests` directory. There are a couple of special categories; for a list
of these, see `testament/categories.nim`, at the bottom.

....
./koch tests c lib
....

For reproducible tests (to reproduce an environment more similar to the one run
by Continuous Integration on travis/appveyor), you may want to disable your
local configuration (eg in `~/.config/nim/nim.cfg`) which may affect some tests;
this can also be achieved by using
`export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=pathtoAlternateConfig` before running `./koch` commands.

= Comparing tests

Because some tests fail in the current `devel` branch, not every failure after
your change is necessarily caused by your changes. Some tests are flaky and will
fail on occasion; these are typically bugs that should be fixed. Test failures
can be grepped using `Failure:`.

The tester can compare two test runs. First, you need to create the reference
test. You'll also need to the commit id, because that's what the tester needs to
know in order to compare the two.

....
git checkout devel
DEVEL_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
./koch tests
....

Then switch over to your changes and run the tester again.

....
git checkout your-changes
./koch tests
....

Then you can ask the tester to create a `testresults.html` which will tell you
if any new tests passed/failed.

....
./koch tests --print html $DEVEL_COMMIT
....

= Deprecation

Backward compatibility is important, so instead of a rename you need to
deprecate the old name and introduce a new name:

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
# for routines (proc/template/macro/iterator) and types:
proc oldProc() {.deprecated: "use `newImpl: string -> int` instead".} = ...

# for (const/var/let) the msg is not yet supported:
const Foo {.deprecated.}  = 1

# for enum types ``deprecated`` is not yet supported.
----

See also
https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#pragmas-deprecated-pragma[Deprecated]
pragma in the manual.

= Documentation

When contributing new procs, be sure to add documentation, especially if the
proc is public. Documentation begins on the line following the `proc`
definition, and is prefixed by `##` on each line.

Runnable code examples are also encouraged, to show typical behavior with a few
test cases (typically 1 to 3 `doAssert` statements, depending on complexity).
These `runnableExamples` are automatically run by `nim doc mymodule.nim` as well
as `testament` and guarantee they stay in sync.

[source,sourceCode,nim
proc addBar*(a: string): string =
## Adds "Bar" to ``a``.
runnableExamples:
doAssert "baz".addBar == "bazBar"]
----
result = a & "Bar"
----

See https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/ospaths.html#parentDir%2Cstring[parentDir]
example.

The RestructuredText Nim uses has a special syntax for including code snippets
embedded in documentation; these are not run by `nim doc` and therefore are not
guaranteed to stay in sync, so `runnableExamples` is usually preferred:

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
proc someproc*(): string =
  ## Return "something"
  ##
  ## .. code-block:: nim
  ##
  ##  echo someproc() # "something"
  result = "something" # single-hash comments do not produce documentation
----

The `.. code-block:: nim` followed by a newline and an indentation instructs the
`nim doc` command to produce syntax-highlighted example code with the
documentation.

When forward declaration is used, the documentation should be included with the
first appearance of the proc.

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
proc hello*(): string
  ## Put documentation here
proc nothing() = discard
proc hello*(): string =
  ## ignore this
  echo "hello"
----

The preferred documentation style is to begin with a capital letter and use the
imperative (command) form. That is, between:

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
proc hello*(): string =
  # Return "hello"
  result = "hello"
----

or

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
proc hello*(): string =
  # says hello
  result = "hello"
----

the first is preferred.

= Best practices

Note: these are general guidelines, not hard rules; there are always exceptions.
Code reviews can just point to a specific section here to save time and
propagate best practices.

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
doAssert isValid() == true
doAssert isValid() # preferred
----

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
let a = (proc (): auto = getFoo())()
let a = block:  # preferred
  getFoo()
----

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
proc foo(cond: bool, lines: seq[string]) # bad
proc foo(lines: seq[string], cond: bool) # preferred
# can be called as: `getLines().foo(false)`
----

rationale: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4089

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
quit() # bad in almost all cases
doAssert() # preferred
----

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
runnableExamples: assert foo() # bad
runnableExamples: doAssert foo() # preferred
----

rationale: it's more flexible (eg allows caller to call custom printing,
including prepending location info, writing to log files, etc).

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
proc foo() = echo "bar" # bad
proc foo(): string = "bar" # preferred (usually)
----

unless stack allocation is needed (eg for efficiency).

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
proc foo(a: var Bar): bool
proc foo(): Option[Bar]
----

except when that's not possible. It's more precise, easier for readers and
maintaners to where expected values refer to. See for example
https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/9335 and https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4089

[source,sourceCode,nim]
----
echo foo() # adds a line in testament `discard` block.
doAssert foo() == [1, 2] # preferred, except when not possible to do so.
----

= The Git stuff

== General commit rules

1.  All changes introduced by the commit (diff lines) must be related to the
subject of the commit.
+
If you change something unrelated to the subject parts of the file, because your
editor reformatted automatically the code or whatever different reason, this
should be excluded from the commit.
+
_Tip:_ Never commit everything as is using `git commit -a`, but review carefully
your changes with `git add -p`.
2.  Changes should not introduce any trailing whitespace.
+
Always check your changes for whitespace errors using `git diff --check` or add
following `pre-commit` hook:
+
[source,sourceCode,sh]
----
#!/bin/sh
git diff --check --cached || exit $?
----
3.  Describe your commit and use your common sense.
+
Example Commit messages: `Fixes #123; refs #124`
+
indicates that issue `#123` is completely fixed (github may automatically close
it when the PR is committed), wheres issue `#124` is referenced (eg: partially
fixed) and won't close the issue when committed.
4.  Commits should be always be rebased against devel (so a fast forward merge
can happen)
+
eg: use `git pull --rebase origin devel`. This is to avoid messing up git
history, see https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/8664[#8664] . Exceptions
should be very rare: when rebase gives too many conflicts, simply squash all
commits using the script shown in https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/pull/9356
5.  Do not mix pure formatting changes (eg whitespace changes, nimpretty) or
automated changes (eg nimfix) with other code changes: these should be in
separate commits (and the merge on github should not squash these into 1).

== Continuous Integration (CI)

1.  Continuous Integration is by default run on every push in a PR; this clogs
the CI pipeline and affects other PR's; if you don't need it (eg for WIP or
documentation only changes), add `[ci skip]` to your commit message title. This
convention is supported by
https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/filtering-commits/#skip-directive-in-commit-message[Appveyor]
and
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/#skipping-a-build[Travis]
2.  Consider enabling CI (travis and appveyor) in your own Nim fork, and waiting
for CI to be green in that fork (fixing bugs as needed) before opening your PR
in original Nim repo, so as to reduce CI congestion. Same applies for updates on
a PR: you can test commits on a separate private branch before updating the main
PR.

== Code reviews

1.  Whenever possible, use github's new 'Suggested change' in code reviews,
which saves time explaining the change or applying it; see also
https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4317

= Documentation Style

== General Guidelines

* Authors should document anything that is exported.
* Within documentation, a period (.) should follow each sentence (or sentence
fragment) in a comment block. The documentation may be limited to one sentence
fragment, but if multiple sentences are within the documentation, each sentence
after the first should be complete and in present tense.
* Documentation is parsed as ReStructuredText (RST).
* Inline code should be surrounded by double tick marks
("```"). If you would like a character to immediately follow inline code (e.g., "`int8`s are great!"), escape the following character with a backslash (``).
The preceding is typed as ``int8`\s are great!``.

== Module-level documentation

Documentation of a module is placed at the top of the module itself. Each line
of documentation begins with double hashes (`##`). Code samples are encouraged,
and should follow the general RST syntax:

[source,sourceCode,Nim]
----
## The ``universe`` module computes the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
##
## .. code-block:: Nim
##  echo computeAnswerString() # "42"
----

Within this top-level comment, you can indicate the authorship and copyright of
the code, which will be featured in the produced documentation.

[source,sourceCode,Nim]
----
## This is the best module ever. It provides answers to everything!
##
## :Author: Steve McQueen
## :Copyright: 1965
##
----

Leave a space between the last line of top-level documentation and the beginning
of Nim code (the imports, etc.).

== Procs, Templates, Macros, Converters, and Iterators

The documentation of a procedure should begin with a capital letter and should
be in present tense. Variables referenced in the documentation should be
surrounded by double tick marks
(```).  .. code-block:: Nim    proc example1*(x: int) =     ## Prints the value of`x`.     echo x  Whenever an example of usage would be helpful to the user, you should include one within the documentation in RST format as below.  .. code-block:: Nim    proc addThree*(x, y, z: int8): int =     ## Adds three`int8`values, treating them as unsigned and     ## truncating the result.     ##     ## .. code-block:: nim     ##  echo addThree(3, 125, 6) # -122     result = x +% y +% z  The commands`nim
doc`and`nim
doc2`will then correctly syntax highlight the Nim code within the documentation.  Types -----  Exported types should also be documented. This documentation can also contain code samples, but those are better placed with the functions to which they refer.  .. code-block:: Nim    type     NamedQueue*[T] = object ## Provides a linked data structure with names                             ## throughout. It is named for convenience. I'm making                             ## this comment long to show how you can, too.       name*: string ## The name of the item       val*: T ## Its value       next*: ref NamedQueue[T] ## The next item in the queue   You have some flexibility when placing the documentation:  .. code-block:: Nim    type     NamedQueue*[T] = object       ## Provides a linked data structure with names       ## throughout. It is named for convenience. I'm making       ## this comment long to show how you can, too.       name*: string ## The name of the item       val*: T ## Its value       next*: ref NamedQueue[T] ## The next item in the queue  Make sure to place the documentation beside or within the object.  .. code-block:: Nim    type     ## This documentation disappears because it annotates the`type`keyword     ## above, not`NamedQueue`.     NamedQueue*[T] = object       name*: string ## This becomes the main documentation for the object, which                     ## is not what we want.       val*: T ## Its value       next*: ref NamedQueue[T] ## The next item in the queue  Var, Let, and Const -------------------  When declaring module-wide constants and values, documentation is encouraged. The placement of doc comments is similar to the`type`sections.  .. code-block:: Nim    const     X* = 42 ## An awesome number.     SpreadArray* = [       [1,2,3],       [2,3,1],       [3,1,2],     ] ## Doc comment for`SpreadArray`.  Placement of comments in other areas is usually allowed, but will not become part of the documentation output and should therefore be prefaced by a single hash (`#``).

[source,sourceCode,Nim]
----
const
  BadMathVals* = [
    3.14, # pi
    2.72, # e
    0.58, # gamma
  ] ## A bunch of badly rounded values.
----

Nim supports Unicode in comments, so the above can be replaced with the
following:

[source,sourceCode,Nim]
----
const
  BadMathVals* = [
    3.14, # π
    2.72, # e
    0.58, # γ
  ] ## A bunch of badly rounded values (including π!).
